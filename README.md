Magneto-Optical Simulation Toolkit ðŸ§ âœ¨

A Python-based research framework for simulating magneto-optical interactions in nanoparticle-doped myelin figures, designed to study soft photonic materials and field-induced waveguiding phenomena.

Overview

This toolkit provides computational tools to explore:

ðŸ§² Magnetic field modulation of myelin figure geometry

ðŸ’¡ Optical wave propagation through anisotropic soft structures

ðŸ§¬ Nanoparticle-enhanced magneto-optical coupling

ðŸ“ˆ Quantitative analysis and visualization of optical and geometric responses

Applications

Modeling field-responsive soft photonic materials

Investigating lightâ€“matter interactions in hybrid biological systems

Supporting quantum-inspired photonic simulations and device design

Research Context

This project contributes to emerging research on magnetically tunable soft photonics, where myelin figures act as biomimetic optical waveguides.
By incorporating magnetic nanoparticles, the system enables dynamic control of light propagation and structure under external fields, providing insight into adaptive optics, quantum information materials, and bio-inspired photonic engineering.
