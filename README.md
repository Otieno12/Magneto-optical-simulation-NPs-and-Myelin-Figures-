Magneto-Optical Myelin Figures: Simulation and Analysis
Overview

This project focuses on the magnetic field modulation of myelin figure geometry and its implications for soft photonic systems. By incorporating magnetic nanoparticles/optical dyes into myelin structures, we investigate how external fields dynamically control geometry and optical wave propagation in anisotropic soft materials.

Key Features

ðŸ§² Magnetic field modulation of myelin figure geometry

ðŸ’¡ Optical wave propagation through anisotropic soft structures

ðŸ§¬ Nanoparticle-enhanced magneto-optical coupling

ðŸ“ˆ Quantitative analysis and visualization of optical and geometric responses

Applications

Modeling field-responsive soft photonic materials

Investigating lightâ€“matter interactions in hybrid biological systems

Research Context

This project contributes to emerging research in magnetically tunable soft photonics, where myelin figures act as biomimetic optical waveguides.
By integrating magnetic nanoparticles, the system enables dynamic control of both light propagation and structural geometry under external magnetic fields.
This provides insight into adaptive optics and bio-inspired photonic engineering.

Requirements

Python â‰¥ 3.9

NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

(Optional) PyElastica, Meep, or custom FEM solvers for mechanics and optics
