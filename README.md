This project focuses on the magnetic field modulation of myelin figure geometry and its implications for soft photonic systems. By incorporating magnetic nanoparticles/optical dyes into myelin structures, we investigate how external fields dynamically control geometry and optical wave propagation in anisotropic soft materials.

Key Features

🧲 Magnetic field modulation of myelin figure geometry

💡 Optical wave propagation through anisotropic soft structures

🧬 Nanoparticle-enhanced magneto-optical coupling

📈 Quantitative analysis and visualization of optical and geometric responses

Applications

Modeling field-responsive soft photonic materials

Investigating light–matter interactions in hybrid biological systems

Research Context

This project contributes to emerging research in magnetically tunable soft photonics, where myelin figures act as biomimetic optical waveguides.
By integrating magnetic nanoparticles, the system enables dynamic control of both light propagation and structural geometry under external magnetic fields.
This provides insight into adaptive optics and bio-inspired photonic engineering.

Requirements

Python ≥ 3.9

NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

(Optional) PyElastica, Meep, or custom FEM solvers for mechanics and optics
